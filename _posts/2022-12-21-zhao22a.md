abstract: 'Graph data augmentation has been used to improve generalizability of graph
  machine learning. However, by only applying fixed augmentation operations on entire
  graphs, existing methods overlook the unique characteristics of communities which
  naturally exist in the graphs. For example, different communities can have various
  degree distributions and homophily ratios. Ignoring such discrepancy with unified
  augmentation strategies on the entire graph could lead to sub-optimal performance
  for graph data augmentation methods. In this paper, we study a novel problem of
  automated graph data augmentation for node classification from the localized perspective
  of communities. We formulate it as a bilevel optimization problem: finding a set
  of augmentation strategies for each community, which maximizes the performance of
  graph neural networks on node classification. As the bilevel optimization is hard
  to solve directly and the search space for community-customized augmentations strategy
  is huge, we propose a reinforcement learning framework AutoGDA that learns the local-optimal
  augmentation strategy for each community sequentially. Our proposed approach outperforms
  established and popular baselines on public node classification benchmarks as well
  as real industry e-commerce networks by up to +12.5% accuracy.'
