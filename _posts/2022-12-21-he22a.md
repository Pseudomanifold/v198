abstract: Neural algorithmic reasoning studies the problem of learning algorithms
  with neural networks, especially using graph architectures. A recent proposal, XLVIN,
  reaps the benefits of using a graph neural network that simulates the value iteration
  algorithm in deep reinforcement learning agents. It allows model-free planning without
  access to privileged information about the environment, which is usually unavailable.
  However, XLVIN only supports discrete action spaces, and is hence nontrivially applicable
  to most tasks of real-world interest. We expand XLVIN to continuous action spaces
  by discretization, and evaluate several selective expansion policies to deal with
  the large planning graphs. Our proposal, CNAP, demonstrates how neural algorithmic
  reasoning can make a measurable impact in higher-dimensional continuous control
  settings, such as MuJoCo, bringing gains in low-data settings and outperforming
  model-free baselines.
