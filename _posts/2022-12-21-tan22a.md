abstract: Few-shot node classification is tasked to provide accurate predictions for
  nodes from novel classes with only few representative labeled nodes. This problem
  has drawn tremendous attention for its projection to prevailing real-world applications,
  such as product categorization for newly added commodity categories on an E-commerce
  platform with scarce records or diagnoses for rare diseases on a patient similarity
  graph. To tackle such challenging label scarcity issues in the non-Euclidean graph
  domain, meta-learning has become a successful and predominant paradigm. More recently,
  inspired by the development of graph self-supervised learning, transferring pretrained
  node embeddings for few-shot node classification could be a promising alternative
  to meta-learning but remains unexposed. In this work, we empirically demonstrate
  the potential of an alternative framework, \textit{Transductive Linear Probing},
  that transfers pretrained node embeddings, which are learned from graph contrastive
  learning methods. We further extend the setting of few-shot node classification
  from standard fully supervised to a more realistic self-supervised setting, where
  meta-learning methods cannot be easily deployed due to the shortage of supervision
  from training classes. Surprisingly, even without any ground-truth labels, transductive
  linear probing with self-supervised graph contrastive pretraining can outperform
  the state-of-the-art fully supervised meta-learning based methods under the same
  protocol. We hope this work can shed new light on few-shot node classification problems
  and foster future research on learning from scarcely labeled instances on graphs.
