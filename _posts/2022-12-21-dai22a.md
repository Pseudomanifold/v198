abstract: 'What target labels are most effective for graph neural network (GNN) training?
  In some applications where GNNs excel-like drug design or fraud detection, labeling
  new instances is expensive. We develop a data-efficient active sampling framework,
  ScatterSample, to train GNNs under an active learning setting. ScatterSample employs
  a sampling module termed DiverseUncertainty to collect instances with large uncertainty
  from different regions of the sample space for labeling. To ensure diversification
  of the selected nodes, DiverseUncertainty clusters the high uncertainty nodes and
  selects the representative nodes from each cluster. Our ScatterSample algorithm
  is further supported by rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating its advantage
  compared to standard active sampling methods that aim to simply maximize the uncertainty
  and not diversify the samples. In particular, we show that ScatterSample is able
  to efficiently reduce the model uncertainty over the whole sample space. Our experiments
  on five datasets show that ScatterSample significantly outperforms the other GNN
  active learning baselines, specifically it reduces the sampling cost by up to 50%
  while achieving the same test accuracy. '
