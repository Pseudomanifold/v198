abstract: 'The Koopman operator theory provides an alternative to studying nonlinear
  networked dynamical systems (NDS) by mapping the state space to an abstract higher
  dimensional space where the system evolution is linear. The recent works show the
  application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn state to object-centric embedding
  and achieve centralized block-wise computation of the Koopman operator (KO) under
  additional assumptions on the underlying node properties and constraints on the
  KO structure. However, the computational complexity of learning the Koopman operator
  increases for large NDS. Moreover, the computational complexity increases in a combinatorial
  fashion with the increase in the number of nodes. The learning challenge is further
  amplified for sparse networks by two factors: 1) sample sparsity for learning the
  Koopman operator in the non-linear space, and 2) the dissimilarity in the dynamics
  of individual nodes or from one subgraph to another.  Our work aims to address these
  challenges by formulating the representation learning of NDS into a multi-agent
  paradigm and learning the Koopman operator in a distributive manner. Our theoretical
  results show that the proposed distributed computation of the geometric Koopman
  operator is beneficial for sparse NDS, whereas for the fully connected systems this
  approach coincides with the centralized one. The empirical study on a rope system,
  a network of oscillators, and a power grid show comparable and superior performance
  along with computational benefits with the state-of-the-art methods.'
