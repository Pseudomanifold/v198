abstract: 'Temporal networks have been widely used to model real-world complex systems
  such as financial systems and e-commerce systems. In a temporal network, the joint
  neighborhood of a set of nodes often provides crucial structural information useful
  for predicting whether they may interact at a certain time. However, recent representation
  learning methods for temporal networks often fail to extract such information or
  depend on online construction of structural features, which is time-consuming. To
  address the issue, this work proposes Neighborhood-Aware Temporal network model
  (NAT). For each node in the network, NAT abandons the commonly-used one-single-vector-based
  representation while adopting a novel dictionary-type neighborhood representation.
  Such a dictionary representation records a downsampled set of the neighboring nodes
  as keys, and allows fast construction of structural features for a joint neighborhood
  of multiple nodes. We also design a dedicated data structure termed N-cache to support
  parallel access and update of those dictionary representations on GPUs. NAT gets
  evaluated over seven real-world large-scale temporal networks. NAT not only outperforms
  all cutting-edge baselines by averaged 1.2% and 4.2% in transductive and inductive
  link prediction accuracy, respectively, but also keeps scalable by achieving a speed-up
  of 4.1-76.7x against the baselines that adopt joint structural features and achieves
  a speed-up of 1.6-4.0x against the baselines that cannot adopt those features. The
