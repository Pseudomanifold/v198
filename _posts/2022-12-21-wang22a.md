abstract: 'Link prediction (LP) has been recognized as an important task in graph
  learning with its broad practical applications. A typical application of LP is to
  retrieve the top scoring neighbors for a given source node, such as the friend recommendation.
  These services desire the high inference scalability to find the top scoring neighbors
  from many candidate nodes at low latencies. There are two popular decoders that
  the recent LP models mainly use to compute the edge scores from node embeddings:
  the \textbf{HadamardMLP} and \textbf{Dot Product} decoders. After theoretical and
  empirical analysis, we find that the HadamardMLP decoders are generally more effective
  for LP. However, HadamardMLP lacks the scalability for retrieving top scoring neighbors
  on large graphs, since to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist an algorithm
  to retrieve the top scoring neighbors for HadamardMLP decoders in sublinear complexity.
  To make HadamardMLP scalable, we propose the \textit{Flashlight} algorithm to accelerate
  the top scoring neighbor retrievals for HadamardMLP: a sublinear algorithm that
  progressively applies approximate maximum inner product search (MIPS) techniques
  with adaptively adjusted query embeddings. Empirical results show that Flashlight
  improves the inference speed of LP by more than 100 times on the large OGBL-CITATION2
  dataset without sacrificing effectiveness. Our work paves the way for large-scale
  LP applications with the effective HadamardMLP decoders by greatly accelerating
  their inference.'
