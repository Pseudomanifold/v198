abstract: 'We introduce graph-time convolutional autoencoder (GTConvAE), a novel spatiotemporal
  architecture tailored to learn unsupervised representations from multivariate time
  series on networks. The GTConvAE leverages product graphs to represent the spatiotemporal
  information and a principled joint convolution operation over this product graph.
  Instead of fixing the product graph at the outset, we make it parametric to learn
  also the spatiotemporal coupling for the task at hand, whereas the convolutional
  filtering parameters learn layer-wise higher-order representations. On top of this,
  we propose temporal downsampling for the encoder to improve the receptive field
  in a spatiotemporal manner without affecting the network structure; respectively,
  in the decoder, we consider the opposite upsampling operator. We prove the GTConvAEs
  with graph integral Lipschitz filters are stable to relative perturbations in the
  network structure, ultimately showing the role of the different components in the
  encoder and decoder on the performance degradation. Numerical experiments for denoising
  and anomaly detection tasks in power and water networks corroborate our finding
  and showcase the effectiveness of the GTConv-AE compared with state-of-the-art alternatives. '
