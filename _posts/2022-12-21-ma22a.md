abstract: 'Establishing open and general benchmarks has been a critical driving force
  behind the success of modern machine learning techniques. As machine learning is
  being applied to broader domains and tasks, there is a need to establish richer
  and more diverse benchmarks to better reflect the reality of the application scenarios.
  Graph learning is an emerging field of machine learning that urgently needs more
  and better benchmarks. To accommodate the need, we introduce Graph Learning Indexer
  (GLI), a benchmark curation platform for graph learning. In comparison to existing
  graph learning benchmark libraries, GLI highlights two novel design objectives.
  First, GLI is designed to incentivize \emph{dataset contributors}. In particular,
  we incorporate various measures to minimize the effort of contributing and maintaining
  a dataset, increase the usability of the contributed dataset, as well as encourage
  attributions to different contributors of the dataset. Second, GLI is designed to
  curate a knowledge base, instead of a plain collection, of benchmark datasets. We
  use multiple sources of meta information to augment the benchmark datasets with
  \emph{rich characteristics}, so that they can be easily selected and used in downstream
  research or development. The source code of GLI is available at \url{https://github.com/Graph-Learning-Benchmarks/gli}. '
