abstract: 'The underlying dynamics and patterns of 3D surface meshes deforming over
  time can be discovered by unsupervised learning, especially autoencoders, which
  calculate low-dimensional embeddings of the surfaces. To study the deformation patterns
  of unseen shapes by transfer learning, we want to train an autoencoder that can
  analyze new surface meshes without training a new network. Here, most state-of-the-art
  autoencoders cannot handle meshes of different connectivity and therefore have limited
  to no generalization capacities to new meshes. Also, reconstruction errors strongly
  increase in comparison to the errors for the training shapes. To address this, we
  propose a novel spectral CoSMA (Convolutional Semi-Regular Mesh Autoencoder) network.
  This patch-based approach is combined with a surface-aware training. It reconstructs
  surfaces not presented during training and generalizes the deformation behavior
  of the surfacesâ€™patches. The novel approach reconstructs unseen meshes from different
  datasets in superior quality compared to state-of-the-art autoencoders that have
  been trained on these shapes. Our transfer learning errors on unseen shapes are
  40% lower than those from models learned directly on the data. Furthermore, baseline
  autoencoders detect deformation patterns of unseen mesh sequences only for the whole
  shape. In contrast, due to the employed regional patches and stable reconstruction
  quality, we can localize where on the surfaces these deformation patterns manifest. '
