abstract: 'Node clustering is a powerful tool in the analysis of networks. We introduce
  a graph neural network framework, named DIGRAC, to obtain node embeddings for directed
  networks in a self-supervised manner, including a novel probabilistic imbalance
  loss, which can be used for network clustering. Here, we propose \textit{directed
  flow imbalance} measures, which are tightly related to directionality, to reveal
  clusters in the network even when there is no density difference between clusters.  In
  contrast to standard approaches in the literature, in this paper, directionality
  is not treated as a nuisance, but rather contains the main signal. DIGRAC optimizes
  directed flow imbalance for clustering without requiring label supervision, unlike
  existing graph neural network methods, and can naturally incorporate node features,
  unlike existing spectral methods. Extensive experimental results on synthetic data,
  in the form of directed stochastic block models, and real-world data at different
  scales, demonstrate that our method, based on flow imbalance, attains state-of-the-art
  results on directed graph clustering when compared against 10 state-of-the-art methods
  from the literature, for a wide range of noise and sparsity levels, graph structures,
  and topologies, and even outperforms supervised methods. '
