abstract: 'Molecular property prediction is a fundamental task in AI-driven drug discovery.
  Deep learning has achieved great success in this task, but relies heavily on abundant
  annotated data. However, annotating molecules is particularly costly because it
  often requires lab experiments conducted by experts. Active Learning (AL) tackles
  this issue by querying (i.e., selecting) the most valuable samples to annotate,
  according to two criteria: uncertainty of the model and diversity of data. Combining
  both criteria (a.k.a. hybrid AL) generally leads to better performance than using
  only one single criterion. However, existing best hybrid methods rely on some trade-off
  hyperparameters for balancing uncertainty and diversity, and hence need to carefully
  tune the hyperparameters in each experiment setting, causing great annotation and
  time inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel AL method that jointly models
  uncertainty and diversity without the trade-off hyperparameters. Specifically, we
  model the joint distribution of the labeled data and the model prediction. Based
  on this distribution, we introduce a Minimum Maximum Probability Querying (MMPQ)
  strategy, in which a single selection score naturally captures how the model is
  uncertain about its prediction, and how dissimilar the sample is to the currently
  labeled data. To model the joint distribution, we adapt the energy-based models
  to the non-Euclidean molecular graph data, by learning chemically-meaningful embedding
  vectors as the proxy of the graphs. We perform extensive experiments on binary classification
  datasets. Results show that our method achieves superior AL performance, outperforming
  existing methods by a large margin. We also conduct ablation studies to verify different
  design choices of our approach.'
