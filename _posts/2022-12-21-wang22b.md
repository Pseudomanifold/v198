abstract: 'The expressive power of GNNs is upper-bounded by the Weisfeiler-Lehman
  (WL) test. To achieve GNNs with high expressiveness, researchers resort to subgraph-based
  GNNs (WL/GNN on subgraphs), deploying GNNs on subgraphs centered around each node
  to encode subgraphs instead of rooted subtrees like WL. However, deploying multiple
  GNNs on subgraphs suffers from much higher computational cost than deploying a single
  GNN on the whole graph, limiting its application to large-size graphs. In this paper,
  we propose a novel paradigm, namely Subgraph-aware WL (SaWL), to obtain graph representation
  that reaches subgraph-level expressiveness with a single GNN. We prove that SaWL
  has beyond-WL capability for graph isomorphism testing, while sharing similar runtime
  to WL. To generalize SaWL to graphs with continuous node features, we propose a
  neural version named Subgraph-aware GNN (SaGNN) to learn graph representation. Both
  SaWL and SaGNN are more expressive than 1-WL while having similar computational
  cost to 1-WL/GNN, without causing much higher complexity like other more expressive
  GNNs. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that fast SaWL
  and SaGNN significantly outperform competitive baseline methods on the task of graph
  classification, while achieving high efficiency. '
