abstract: 'Reasoning about the relationships between entities from input facts (e.g.,
  whether Ari is a grandparent of Charlie) generally requires explicit consideration
  of other entities that are not mentioned in the query (e.g., the parents of Charlie).
  In this paper, we present an approach for learning to solve problems of this kind
  in large, real-world domains, using sparse and local hypergraph neural networks
  (SpaLoc). SpaLoc is motivated by two observations from traditional logic-based reasoning:
  relational inferences usually apply locally (i.e., involve only a small number of
  individuals), and relations are usually sparse (i.e., only hold for a small percentage
  of tuples in a domain). We exploit these properties to make learning and inference
  efficient in very large domains by (1) using a sparse tensor representation for
  hypergraph neural networks, (2) applying a sparsification loss during training to
  encourage sparse representations, and (3) subsampling based on a novel information
  sufficiencyâ€“based sampling process during training. SpaLoc achieves state-of-the-art
  performance on several real-world, large-scale knowledge graph reasoning benchmarks,
  and is the first framework for applying hypergraph neural networks on real-world
  knowledge graphs with more than 10k nodes.'
