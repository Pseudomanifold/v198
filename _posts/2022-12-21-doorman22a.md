abstract: A key problem in network theory is how to reconfigure a graph in order to
  optimize a quantifiable objective. Given the ubiquity of networked systems, such
  work has broad practical applications in a variety of situations, ranging from drug
  and material design to telecommunications. The large decision space of possible
  reconfigurations, however, makes this problem computationally intensive. In this
  paper, we cast the problem of network rewiring for optimizing a specified structural
  property as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which a decision-maker is given
  a budget of modifications that are performed sequentially. We then propose a general
  approach based on the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm and graph neural networks (GNNs)
  that can efficiently learn strategies for rewiring networks.  We then discuss a
  cybersecurity case study, i.e., an application to the computer network reconfiguration
  problem for intrusion protection. In a typical scenario, an attacker might have
  a (partial) map of the system they plan to penetrate; if the network is effectively
  "scrambled", they would not be able to navigate it since their prior knowledge would
  become obsolete. This can be viewed as an entropy maximization problem, in which
  the goal is to increase the surprise of the network. Indeed, entropy acts as a proxy
  measurement of the difficulty of navigating the network topology. We demonstrate
  the general ability of the proposed method to obtain better entropy gains than random
  rewiring on synthetic and real-world graphs while being computationally inexpensive,
  as well as being able to generalize to larger graphs than those seen during training.
  Simulations of attack scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the learned rewiring
  strategies.
