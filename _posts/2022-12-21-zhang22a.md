abstract: 'This paper aims for set-to-hypergraph prediction, where the goal is to
  infer the set of relations for a given set of entities. This is a common abstraction
  for applications in particle physics, biological systems and combinatorial optimization.
  We address two common scaling problems encountered in set-to-hypergraph tasks that
  limit the size of the input set: the exponentially growing number of hyperedges
  and the run-time complexity, both leading to higher memory requirements. We make
  three contributions. First, we propose to predict and supervise the positive edges
  only, which changes the asymptotic memory scaling from exponential to linear. Second,
  we introduce a training method that encourages iterative refinement of the predicted
  hypergraph, which allows us to skip iterations in the backward pass for improved
  efficiency and constant memory usage. Third, we combine both contributions in a
  single set-to-hypergraph model that enables us to address problems with larger input
  set sizes. We provide ablations for our main technical contributions and show that
  our model outperforms prior state-of-the-art, especially for larger sets.'
