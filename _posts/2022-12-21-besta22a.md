abstract: Graph databases (GDBs) enable processing and analysis of unstructured, complex,
  rich, and usually vast graph datasets. Despite the large significance of GDBs in
  both academia and industry, little effort has been made into integrating them with
  the predictive power of graph neural networks (GNNs).  In this work, we show how
  to seamlessly combine nearly any GNN model with the computational capabilities of
  GDBs. For this, we observe that the majority of these systems are based on a graph
  data model called the Labeled Property Graph (LPG), where vertices and edges can
  have arbitrarily complex sets of labels and properties. We then develop LPG2vec,
  an encoder that transforms an arbitrary LPG dataset into a representation that can
  be directly used with a broad class of GNNs, including convolutional, attentional,
  message-passing, and even higher-order or spectral models.  In our evaluation, we
  show that the rich information represented as LPG labels and properties is properly
  preserved by LPG2vec, and it increases the accuracy of predictions regardless of
  the targeted learning task or the used GNN model, by up to 34% compared to graphs
  with no LPG labels/properties.  In general, LPG2vec enables combining predictive
  power of the most powerful GNNs with the full scope of information encoded in the
  LPG model, paving the way for neural graph databases, a class of systems where the
  vast complexity of maintained data will benefit from modern and future graph machine
  learning methods.
