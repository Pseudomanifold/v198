abstract: Most graph neural network models rely on a particular message passing paradigm,
  where the idea is to iteratively propagate node representations of a graph to each
  node in the direct neighborhood. While very prominent, this paradigm leads to information
  propagation bottlenecks, as information is repeatedly compressed at intermediary
  node representations, which causes loss of information, making it practically impossible
  to gather meaningful signals from distant nodes. To address this, we propose shortest
  path message passing neural networks, where the node representations of a graph
  are propagated to each node in the shortest path neighborhoods. In this setting,
  nodes can directly communicate between each other even if they are not neighbors,
  breaking the information bottleneck and hence leading to more adequately learned
  representations. Our framework generalizes message passing neural networks, resulting
  in a class of more expressive models, including some recent state-of-the-art models.
  We verify the capacity of a basic model of this framework on dedicated synthetic
  experiments, and on real-world graph classification and regression benchmarks, and
  obtain state-of-the art results.
