abstract: 'While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently become the de facto standard
  for modeling relational data, they impose a strong assumption on the availability
  of the node or edge features of the graph.  In many real-world applications, however,
  features are only partially available; for example, in social networks, age and
  gender are available only for a small subset of users. We present a general approach
  for handling missing features in graph machine learning applications that is based
  on minimization of the Dirichlet energy and leads to a diffusion-type differential
  equation on the graph. The discretization of this equation produces a simple, fast
  and scalable algorithm which we call Feature Propagation. We experimentally show
  that the proposed approach outperforms previous methods on seven common node-classification
  benchmarks and can withstand surprisingly high rates of missing features: on average
  we observe only around 4% relative accuracy drop when 99% of the features are missing.
  Moreover, it takes only 10 seconds to run on a graph with ~2.5M nodes and ~23M edges
  on a single GPU. The code is available at https://github.com/twitter-research/feature-propagation.'
