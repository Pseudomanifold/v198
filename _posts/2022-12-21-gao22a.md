abstract: 'Recently the Transformer structure has shown good performances in graph
  learning tasks. However, these Transformer models directly work on graph nodes and
  may have difficulties learning high-level information. Inspired by the vision transformer,
  which applies to image patches, we propose a new Transformer-based graph neural
  network: Patch Graph Transformer (PatchGT). Unlike previous transformer-based models
  for learning graph representations, PatchGT learns from non-trainable graph patches,
  not from nodes directly. It can help save computation and improve the model performance.
  The key idea is to segment a graph into patches based on spectral clustering without
  any trainable parameters, with which the model can first use GNN layers to learn
  patch-level representations and then use Transformer layers to obtain graph-level
  representations. The architecture leverages the spectral information of graphs and
  combines the strengths of GNNs and Transformers. Further, We show the limitations
  of previous hierarchical trainable clusters theoretically and empirically. We also
  prove the proposed non-trainable spectral clustering method is permutation invariant
  and can help address the information bottlenecks in the graph. PatchGT achieves
  higher expressiveness than 1-WL-type GNNs, and the empirical study shows that PatchGT
  achieves competitive performances on benchmark datasets and provides interpretability
  to its predictions. The implementation of our algorithm is released at our GitHub
  repo: https://github.com/tufts-ml/PatchGT.'
