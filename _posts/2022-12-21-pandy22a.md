abstract: Searching for a path between two nodes in a graph is one of the most well-studied
  and fundamental problems in computer science. In numerous domains such as robotics,
  AI, or biology, practitioners develop search heuristics to accelerate their pathfinding
  algorithms. However, it is a laborious and complex process to hand-design heuristics
  based on the problem and the structure of a given use case. Here we present PHIL
  (Path Heuristic with Imitation Learning), a novel neural architecture and a training
  algorithm for discovering graph search and navigation heuristics from data by leveraging
  recent advances in imitation learning and graph representation learning. At training
  time, we aggregate datasets of search trajectories and ground-truth shortest path
  distances, which we use to train a specialized graph neural network-based heuristic
  function using backpropagation through steps of the pathfinding process. Our heuristic
  function learns graph embeddings useful for inferring node distances, runs in constant
  time independent of graph sizes, and can be easily incorporated in an algorithm
  such as A\ast  at test time. Experiments show that PHIL reduces the number of explored
  nodes compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets by 58.5% on average,
  can be directly applied in diverse graphs ranging from biological networks to road
  networks, and allows for fast planning in time-critical robotics domains.
