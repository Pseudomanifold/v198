abstract: 'Graph serves as a powerful tool for modeling data that has an underlying
  structure in non-Euclidean space, by encoding relations as edges and entities as
  nodes. Despite developments in learning from graph-structured data over the years,
  one obstacle persists: graph imbalance. Although several attempts have been made
  to target this problem, they are limited to considering only class-level imbalance.
  In this work, we argue that for graphs, the imbalance is likely to exist at the
  sub-class topology group level. Due to the flexibility of topology structures, graphs
  could be highly diverse, and learning a generalizable classification boundary would
  be difficult. Therefore, several majority topology groups may dominate the learning
  process, rendering others under-represented. To address this problem, we propose
  a new framework {\method} and design (1 a topology extractor, which automatically
  identifies the topology group for each instance with explicit memory cells, (2 a
  training modulator, which modulates the learning process of the target GNN model
  to prevent the case of topology-group-wise under-representation. {\method} can be
  used as a key component in GNN models to improve their performances under the data
  imbalance setting. Analyses on both topology-level imbalance and the proposed {\method}
  are provided theoretically, and we empirically verify its effectiveness with both
  node-level and graph-level classification as the target tasks.'
