abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous in encoding relational information of real-world objects
  in many domains. Graph generation, whose purpose is to generate new graphs from
  a distribution similar to the observed graphs, has received increasing attention
  thanks to the recent advances of deep learning models. In this paper, we conduct
  a comprehensive review on the existing literature of deep graph generation from
  a variety of emerging methods to its wide application areas. Specifically, we first
  formulate the problem of deep graph generation and discuss its difference with several
  related graph learning tasks. Secondly, we divide the state-of-the-art methods into
  three categories based on model architectures and summarize their generation strategies.
  Thirdly, we introduce three key application areas of deep graph generation. Lastly,
  we highlight challenges and opportunities in the future study of deep graph generation.
  We hope that our survey will be useful for researchers and practitioners who are
  interested in this exciting and rapidly-developing field.
