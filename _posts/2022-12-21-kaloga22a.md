abstract: The choice of good distances and similarity measures between objects is
  important for many machine learning methods. Therefore, many metric learning algorithms
  have been developed in recent years, mainly for Euclidean data in order to improve
  performance of classification or clustering methods. However, due to difficulties
  in establishing computable, efficient and differentiable distances between attributed
  graphs, few metric learning algorithms adapted to graphs have been developed despite
  the strong interest of the community.  In this paper, we address this issue by proposing
  a new Simple Graph Metric Learning - SGML - model with few trainable parameters
  based on Simple Convolutional Neural Networks - SGCN - and elements of optimal transport
  theory. This model allows us to build an appropriate distance from  a database of
  labeled (attributed) graphs to improve the performance of simple classification
  algorithms such as \textdollar k\textdollar -NN. This distance can be quickly trained
  while maintaining good performances as illustrated by the experimental study presented
  in this paper.
