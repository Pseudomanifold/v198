abstract: Graph-based machine learning is experiencing explosive growth, driven by
  impressive recent developments and wide applicability. Typical approaches for graph
  representation learning predominantly focus on pairwise interactions, while neglecting
  the patterns of higher-order interactions common to complex systems. This paper
  explores many-body interaction models, centering on simplicial complexes. From a
  theoretical point of view, we offer a pair of insights illustrating why higher-order
  models are necessary, why non-graph-based models generally cannot generalize well,
  while graph-based models may be able to do so. We conduct experiments on synthetic
  data, co-citation networks, co-authorship networks and gene-disease associations
  and show that simplicial complexes with certain relaxations can more efficiently
  capture underlying higher-order structures than non-graph structure, regular graph,
  hypergraph, and traditional simplicial complex-based learning frameworks.
