abstract: This work establishes a fully-spectral framework to capture informative
  long-range temporal interactions in a dynamic system. We connect the spectral transform
  to the low-rank self-attention mechanisms and investigate its energy-balancing effect
  and computational efficiency. Based on the observations, we leverage the adaptive
  power method SVD and global graph framelet convolution to encode time-dependent
  features and graph structure for continuous-time dynamic graph representation learning.
  The former serves as an efficient high-order linear self-attention with determined
  propagation rules, and the latter establishes scalable and transferable geometric
  characterization for property prediction. Empirically, the proposed model learns
  well-conditioned hidden representations on a variety of online learning tasks, and
  it achieves top performance with a reduced number of learnable parameters and faster
  propagation speed.
