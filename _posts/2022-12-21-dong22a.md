abstract: Link prediction is a crucial problem in graph-structured data. Due to the
  recent success of graph neural networks (GNNs), a variety of GNN-based models were
  proposed to tackle the link prediction task. Specifically, GNNs leverage the message
  passing paradigm to obtain node representation, which relies on link connectivity.
  However, in a link prediction task, links in the training set are always present
  while ones in the testing set are not yet formed, resulting in a discrepancy of
  the connectivity pattern and bias of the learned representation. It leads to a problem
  of dataset shift which degrades the model performance. In this paper, we first identify
  the dataset shift problem in the link prediction task and provide theoretical analyses
  on how existing link prediction methods are vulnerable to it. We then propose FakeEdge,
  a model-agnostic technique, to address the problem by mitigating the graph topological
  gap between training and testing sets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the applicability
  and superiority of FakeEdge on multiple datasets across various domains.
