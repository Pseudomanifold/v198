abstract: 'Methods that learn graph topological representations are becoming the usual
  choice to extract features to help solve machine learning tasks on graphs. In particular,
  low-dimensional encoding of graph nodes can be exploited in tasks such as link prediction
  and network reconstruction, where pairwise node embedding similarity is interpreted
  as the likelihood of an edge incidence. The presence of polyadic interactions in
  many real-world complex systems is leading to the emergence of representation learning
  techniques able to describe systems that include such polyadic relations. Despite
  this, their application on estimating the likelihood of tuple-wise edges is still
  underexplored.  Here we focus on the reconstruction and prediction of simplices
  (higher-order links) in the form of classification tasks, where the likelihood of
  interacting groups is computed from the embedding features of a simplicial complex.
  Using similarity scores based on geometric properties of the learned metric space,
  we show how the resulting node-level and group-level feature embeddings are beneficial
  to predict unseen simplices, as well as to reconstruct the topology of the original
  simplicial structure, even when training data contain only records of lower-order
  simplices. '
