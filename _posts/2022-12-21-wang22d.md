abstract: Modeling molecular potential energy surface is of pivotal importance in
  science. Graph Neural Networks have shown great success in this field. However,
  their message passing schemes need special designs to capture geometric information
  and fulfill symmetry requirement like rotation equivariance, leading to complicated
  architectures. To avoid these designs, we introduce a novel local frame method to
  molecule representation learning and analyze its expressivity. Projected onto a
  frame, equivariant features like 3D coordinates are converted to invariant features,
  so that we can capture geometric information with these projections and decouple
  the symmetry requirement from GNN design. Theoretically, we prove that given non-degenerate
  frames, even ordinary GNNs can encode molecules injectively and reach maximum expressivity
  with coordinate projection and frame-frame projection. In experiments, our model
  uses a simple ordinary GNN architecture yet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy.
  The simpler architecture also leads to higher scalability. Our model only takes
  about \textdollar 30\%\textdollar  inference time and \textdollar 10\%\textdollar  GPU
  memory compared to the most efficient baselines.
