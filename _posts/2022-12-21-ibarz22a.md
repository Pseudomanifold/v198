abstract: The cornerstone of neural algorithmic reasoning is the ability to solve
  algorithmic tasks, especially in a way that generalises out of distribution. While
  recent years have seen a surge in methodological improvements in this area, they
  mostly focused on building specialist models. Specialist models are capable of learning
  to neurally execute either only one algorithm or a collection of algorithms with
  identical control-flow backbone. Here, instead, we focus on constructing a generalist
  neural algorithmic learner—a single graph neural network processor capable of learning
  to execute a wide range of algorithms, such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming,
  path-finding and geometry. We leverage the CLRS benchmark to empirically show that,
  much like recent successes in the domain of perception, generalist algorithmic learners
  can be built by "incorporating" knowledge. That is, it is possible to effectively
  learn algorithms in a multi-task manner, so long as we can learn to execute them
  well in a single-task regime. Motivated by this, we present a series of improvements
  to the input representation, training regime and processor architecture over CLRS,
  improving average single-task performance by over 20% from prior art. We then conduct
  a thorough ablation of multi-task learners leveraging these improvements. Our results
  demonstrate a generalist learner that effectively incorporates knowledge captured
  by specialist models.
