abstract: In this paper we study the practicality and usefulness of incorporating
  distributed representations of graphs into models within the context of drug pair
  scoring. We argue that the real world growth and update cycles of drug pair scoring
  datasets subvert the limitations of transductive learning associated with distributed
  representations. Furthermore, we argue that the vocabulary of discrete substructure
  patterns induced over drug sets is not dramatically large due to the limited set
  of atom types and constraints on bonding patterns enforced by chemistry. Under this
  pretext, we explore the effectiveness of distributed representations of the molecular
  graphs of drugs in drug pair scoring tasks such as drug synergy, polypharmacy, and
  drug-drug interaction prediction. To achieve this, we present a methodology for
  learning and incorporating distributed representations of graphs within a unified
  framework for drug pair scoring. Subsequently, we augment a number of recent and
  state-of-the-art models to utilise our embeddings. We empirically show that the
  incorporation of these embeddings improves downstream performance of almost every
  model across different drug pair scoring tasks, even those the original model was
  not designed for. We publicly release all of our drug embeddings for the DrugCombDB,
  DrugComb, DrugbankDDI, and TwoSides datasets.
