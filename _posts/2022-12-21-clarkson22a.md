abstract: 'Generative models for network time series (also known as dynamic graphs)
  have tremendous potential in fields such as epidemiology, biology and economics,
  where complex graph-based dynamics are core objects of study. Designing flexible
  and scalable generative models is a very challenging task due to the high dimensionality
  of the data, as well as the need to represent temporal dependencies and marginal
  network structure. Here we introduce DAMNETS, a scalable deep generative model for
  network time series. DAMNETS outperforms competing methods on all of our measures
  of sample quality, over both real and synthetic data sets. '
