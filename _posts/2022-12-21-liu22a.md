abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) extend the success of neural networks to graph-structured
  data by accounting for their intrinsic geometry. While extensive research has been
  done on developing GNN models with superior performance according to a collection
  of graph representation learning benchmarks, it is currently not well understood
  what aspects of a given model are probed by them. For example, to what extent do
  they test the ability of a model to leverage graph structure vs. node features?
  Here, we develop a principled approach to taxonomize benchmarking datasets according
  to a \textdollar \textit{sensitivity profile}\textdollar  that is based on how much
  GNN performance changes due to a collection of graph perturbations. Our data-driven
  analysis provides a deeper understanding of which benchmarking data characteristics
  are leveraged by GNNs. Consequently, our taxonomy can aid in selection and development
  of adequate graph benchmarks, and better informed evaluation of future GNN methods.
  Finally, our approach is designed to be extendable to multiple graph prediction
  task types and future datasets.
