abstract: As one of the most popular machine learning models today, graph neural networks
  (GNNs) have attracted intense interest recently, and so does their explainability.
  Unfortunately, todayâ€™s evaluation frameworks for GNN explainability often rely on
  few inadequate synthetic datasets, leading to conclusions of limited scope due to
  a lack of complexity in the problem instances. As GNN models are deployed to more
  mission-critical applications, we are in dire need for a common evaluation protocol
  of explainability methods of GNNs. In this paper, we propose, to our best knowledge,
  the first systematic evaluation framework for GNN explainability GraphFramEx, considering
  explainability on three different "user needs". We propose a unique metric, the
  characterization score, which combines the fidelity measures and classifies explanations
  based on their quality of being sufficient or necessary. We scope ourselves to node
  classification tasks and compare the most representative techniques in the field
  of input-level explainability for GNNs. We found that personalized PageRank has
  the best performance for synthetic benchmarks, but gradient-based methods outperform
  for tasks with complex graph structure. However, none dominates the others on all
  evaluation dimensions and there is always a trade-off. We further apply our evaluation
  protocol in a case study for frauds explanation on eBay transaction graphs to reflect
  the production environment.
