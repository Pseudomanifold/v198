abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in modeling
  graphs for various applications. However, most existing GNNs assume the graphs exhibit
  strong homophily in node labels, i.e., nodes with similar labels are connected in
  the graphs. They fail to generalize to heterophilic graphs where linked nodes may
  have dissimilar labels and attributes. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate
  a novel framework that performs well on graphs with either homophily or heterophily.
  More specifically,  we propose a label-wise message passing mechanism to avoid the
  negative effects caused by aggregating dissimilar node representations and preserve
  the heterophilic contexts for representation learning. We further propose a bi-level
  optimization method to automatically select the model for graphs with homophily/heterophily.
  Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments  demonstrate the effectiveness of
  our proposed framework for node classification on both homophilic and heterophilic
  graphs.
