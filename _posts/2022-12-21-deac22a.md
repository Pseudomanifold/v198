abstract: 'Deploying graph neural networks (GNNs) on whole-graph classification or
  regression tasks is known to be challenging: it often requires computing node features
  that are mindful of both local interactions in their neighbourhood and the global
  context of the graph structure. GNN architectures that navigate this space need
  to avoid pathological behaviours, such as bottlenecks and oversquashing, while ideally
  having linear time and space complexity requirements. In this work, we propose an
  elegant approach based on propagating information over expander graphs. We leverage
  an efficient method for constructing expander graphs of a given size, and use this
  insight to propose the EGP model. We show that EGP is able to address all of the
  above concerns, while requiring minimal effort to set up, and provide evidence of
  its empirical utility on relevant graph classification datasets and baselines in
  the Open Graph Benchmark. Importantly, using expander graphs as a template for message
  passing necessarily gives rise to negative curvature. While this appears to be counterintuitive
  in light of recent related work on oversquashing, we theoretically demonstrate that
  negatively curved edges are likely to be required to obtain scalable message passing
  without bottlenecks. To the best of our knowledge, this is a previously unstudied
  result in the context of graph representation learning, and we believe our analysis
  paves the way to a novel class of scalable methods to counter oversquashing in GNNs.'
