abstract: 'Node embedding methods map network nodes to low dimensional vectors that
  can be subsequently used in a variety of downstream prediction tasks. The popularity
  of these methods has grown significantly in recent years, yet, their robustness
  to perturbations of the input data is still poorly understood. In this paper, we
  assess the empirical robustness of node embedding models to random and adversarial
  poisoning attacks. Our systematic evaluation covers representative embedding methods
  based on Skip-Gram, matrix factorization, and deep neural networks. We compare edge
  addition, deletion and rewiring attacks computed using network properties as well
  as node labels. We also investigate the performance of popular node classification
  attack baselines that assume full knowledge of the node labels. We report qualitative
  results via embedding visualization and quantitative results in terms of downstream
  node classification and network reconstruction performances. We find that node classification
  results are impacted more than network reconstruction ones, that degree-based and
  label-based attacks are on average the most damaging and that label heterophily
  can strongly influence attack performance. '
