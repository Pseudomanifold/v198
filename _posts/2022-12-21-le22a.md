abstract: Learning and reasoning about 3D molecular structures with varying size is
  an emerging and important challenge in machine learning and especially in the development
  of biotherapeutics. Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can simultaneously
  leverage the geometric and relational detail of the problem domain and are known
  to learn expressive representations through the propagation of information between
  nodes leveraging higher-order representations to faithfully express the geometry
  of the data, such as directionality in their intermediate layers. In this work,
  we propose an equivariant GNN that operates with Cartesian coordinates to incorporate
  directionality and we implement a novel attention mechanism, acting as a content
  and spatial dependent filter when propagating information between nodes. Our proposed
  message function processes vector features in a geometrically meaningful way by
  mixing existing vectors and creating new ones based on cross products. We demonstrate
  the efficacy of our architecture on accurately predicting properties of large biomolecules
  and show its computational advantage over recent methods which rely on irreducible
  representations by means of the spherical harmonics expansion.
