abstract: 'Node similarity scores are a foundation for machine learning in graphs
  for clustering, node classification, anomaly detection, and link prediction with
  applications in biological systems, information networks, and recommender systems.
  Recent works on link prediction use vector space embeddings to calculate node similarities
  in undirected networks with good performance. Still, they have several disadvantages:
  limited interpretability, need for hyperparameter tuning, manual model fitting through
  dimensionality reduction, and poor performance from symmetric similarities in directed
  link prediction. We propose MapSim, an information-theoretic measure to assess node
  similarities based on modular compression of network flows. Unlike vector space
  embeddings, MapSim represents nodes in a discrete, non-metric space of communities
  and yields asymmetric similarities in an unsupervised fashion. We compare MapSim
  on a link prediction task to popular embedding-based algorithms across 47 networks
  and find that MapSim’s average performance across all networks is more than 7% higher
  than its closest competitor, outperforming all embedding methods in 11 of the 47
  networks. Our method demonstrates the potential of compression-based approaches
  in graph representation learning, with promising applications in other graph learning
  tasks.'
