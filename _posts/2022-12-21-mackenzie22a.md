abstract: 'Evaluation of a cancer patientâ€™s prognostic outlook is an essential step
  in the clinical decision-making process, involving the assessment of complex tissue
  structures in multi-gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). Effective risk stratification
  of patients from WSIs has proven challenging despite several approaches across the
  literature due to their large size and inability of existing approaches to effectively
  model inter-relationships between different tissue components. We propose a graph
  neural network (GNN) model that performs pairwise ranking of graph representations
  of WSIs based on survival scores. The proposed approach translates spatially-localised
  deep features along with their spatial context to a graph neural network to produce
  survival scores.  Analysis over breast cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas
  (TCGA) shows that the proposed GNN approach is able to rank patients with respect
  to their disease-specific survival times with a concordance index of \textdollar
  0.672 \pm 0.058\textdollar . This is a significant improvement over existing state
  of the art and paves the way for neural graph modelling of WSI data for survival
  prediction for other cancer types. '
