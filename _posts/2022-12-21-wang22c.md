abstract: 'Many real-world applications can be formulated as event forecasting on
  Continuous Time Dynamic Graphs (CTDGs) where the occurrence of a timed event between
  two entities is represented as an edge along with its occurrence timestamp. However,
  many previous works handle the problem in compromised settings, either formulating
  it as a link prediction task on the graph given the event time, or a time prediction
  problem for which event will happen next. In this paper, we propose a novel model
  combining Graph Neural Networks and Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) that jointly
  forecasts multiple link events and their timestamps on communities over a CTDG.
  Moreover, to scale our model to large graphs, we factorize the joint event prediction
  problem into three easier conditional probability modeling problems. To evaluate
  the effectiveness of our model and the rationale behind such a decomposition, we
  establish a set of benchmarks and evaluation metrics. The experimental results demonstrate
  the superiority of our model in terms of both accuracy and training efficiency.
  All the source codes and datasets are available in a GitHub repository. '
