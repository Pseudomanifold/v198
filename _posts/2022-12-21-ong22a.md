abstract: 'Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been shown to be highly sensitive to
  the choice of aggregation function. While summing over a node’s neighbours can approximate
  any permutation-invariant function over discrete inputs, Cohen-Karlik et al. [2020]
  proved there are set-aggregation problems for which summing cannot generalise to
  unbounded inputs, proposing recurrent neural networks regularised towards permutation-invariance
  as a more expressive aggregator. We show that these results carry over to the graph
  domain: GNNs equipped with recurrent aggregators are competitive with state-of-the-art
  permutation-invariant aggregators, on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world problems.
  However, despite the benefits of recurrent aggregators, their O(V) depth makes them
  both difficult to parallelise and harder to train on large graphs. Inspired by the
  observation that a well-behaved aggregator for a GNN is a commutative monoid over
  its latent space, we propose a framework for constructing learnable, commutative,
  associative binary operators. And with this, we construct an aggregator of O(log
  V) depth, yielding exponential improvements for both parallelism and dependency
  length while achieving performance competitive with recurrent aggregators. Based
  on our empirical observations, our proposed learnable commutative monoid (LCM) aggregator
  represents a favourable tradeoff between efficient and expressive aggregators.'
