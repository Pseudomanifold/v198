abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been increasingly deployed in various
  applications that involve learning on non-Euclidean data. However, recent studies
  show that GNNs are vulnerable to graph adversarial attacks. Although there are several
  defense methods to improve GNN robustness by eliminating adversarial components,
  they may also impair the underlying clean graph structure that contributes to GNN
  training. In addition, few of those defense models can scale to large graphs due
  to their high computational complexity and memory usage. In this paper, we propose
  GARNET, a scalable spectral method to boost the adversarial robustness of GNN models.
  GARNET first leverages weighted spectral embedding to construct a base graph, which
  is not only resistant to adversarial attacks but also contains critical (clean)
  graph structure for GNN training. Next, GARNET further refines the base graph by
  pruning additional uncritical edges based on probabilistic graphical model. GARNET
  has been evaluated on various datasets, including a large graph with millions of
  nodes. Our extensive experiment results show that GARNET achieves adversarial accuracy
  improvement and runtime speedup over state-of-the-art GNN (defense) models by up
  to \textdollar 10.23\%\textdollar  and \textdollar 14.7\times\textdollar , respectively.
