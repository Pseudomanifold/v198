abstract: The classical Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm aka color refinement is fundamental
  for graph learning with kernels and neural networks. Originally developed for graph
  isomorphism testing, the algorithm iteratively refines vertex colors. On many datasets,
  the stable coloring is reached after a few iterations and the optimal number of
  iterations for machine learning tasks is typically even lower. This suggests that
  the colors diverge too fast, defining a similarity that is too coarse. We generalize
  the concept of color refinement and propose a framework for gradual neighborhood
  refinement, which allows a slower convergence to the stable coloring and thus provides
  a more fine-grained refinement hierarchy and vertex similarity. We assign new colors
  by clustering vertex neighborhoods, replacing the original injective color assignment
  function. Our approach is used to derive new variants of existing graph kernels
  and to approximate the graph edit distance via optimal assignments regarding vertex
  similarity. We show that in both tasks, our method outperforms the original color
  refinement with only a moderate increase in running time advancing the state of
  the art.
