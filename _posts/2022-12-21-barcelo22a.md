abstract: Knowledge graphs, modeling multi-relational data, improve numerous applications
  such as question answering or graph logical reasoning. Many graph neural networks
  for such data emerged recently, often outperforming shallow architectures. However,
  the design of such multi-relational graph neural networks is ad-hoc, driven mainly
  by intuition and empirical insights. Up to now, their expressivity, their relation
  to each other, and their (practical) learning performance is poorly understood.
  Here, we initiate the study of deriving a more principled understanding of multi-relational
  graph neural networks. Namely, we investigate the limitations in the expressive
  power of the well-known Relational GCN and Compositional GCN architectures and shed
  some light on their practical learning performance. By aligning both architectures
  with a suitable version of the Weisfeiler-Leman test, we establish under which conditions
  both models have the same expressive power in distinguishing non-isomorphic (multi-relational)
  graphs or vertices with different structural roles. Further, by leveraging recent
  progress in designing expressive graph neural networks, we introduce the \textdollar
  k\textdollar -RN  architecture that provably overcomes the expressiveness limitations
  of the above two architectures. Empirically, we confirm our theoretical findings
  in a vertex classification setting over small and large multi-relational graphs.
